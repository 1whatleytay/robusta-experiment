# robusta - An NES emulator experiment

I started this project to get a better hang on Kotlin and to create a better version of Nem now that I have more experience.
I knew how to finish it, but I got bored quickly.
I already knew how to solve all the problems and Kotlin wasn't built for the low level bitshift operations that are required for the 6502.
This project was scrapped, but I am uploading it here to keep a record.
